# **💊MyDrugs**

Mydrugs is a clone of the popular MyDrugs website from the Netflix web series "How to Sell Drugs Online (fast)". I built this clone since i like the design used on the website and felt fascinated to recreate it myself so that i can learn myself as i just completed learning css and html from the odin project.



# 📦Technologies

- HTML
- CSS



# **🦄Features**

Well theres nothing much you can do with this website. I just build it to learn what processes are happening and how the layout processes work. The technologies used in this website are basic css and html and javascript has not been used yet i am only starting to learn javascript.



# **👩🏽‍🍳The Process**

The header page was easy to make as i put it as a flex with space between it to evenly distribute it and both the left and right elements were indivitual flex boxes so that they can be laid out left and right respectively. i used sticky position to keep it on top as a header.

The first page took some time for me to understand how to overlay an element on top of the picture. I used absolute postition but instead of coordinates i used the % so that the value stays the same even when the window is resized. I also used the translate transform function to animate the window resizing movement smooth.

The last page i divided the page into two flexboxes and aligned it right and left respectively with adequate margin in between.

# **📚What I Learned**

- I learned about vw and vh about viewport property

- Overlapping is mostly achieved by position absolute

- Text align only works for inline elements, so i learned to understand that convert the element to inline to align it like a text

# **📈Overall Growth:**

I learned alot of things about aligning and layouting in css and also the flexbox properties and how it should be positioned. I also understood that in the HTML file always put things inside a div is you want it to give it the properties of a flexbox.

# **💭How can it be improved?**

I believe i can improve it by  learning more about layouting more images and text but since i dont know much javascript i am limited to this website so once i learn javascript i will be more able to design websites with more responsiveness.
